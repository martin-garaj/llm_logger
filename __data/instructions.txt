https://www.techrepublic.com/article/benchmark-ubuntu-linux-servers-phoronix-test-suite/

1) Create a folder and 'cd' to the folder
mkdir perfromance
cd ./performance

sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade

2) Download Phoronix test suite
wget https://phoronix-test-suite.com/releases/repo/pts.debian/files/phoronix-test-suite_10.8.3_all.deb


3) Install (the first command fails due to the lack of dependencies, the second command installs all)
sudo dpkg -i phoronix*.deb
sudo apt --fix-broken install


4) Check installation:
phoronix-test-suite
